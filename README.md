# Howami

All unix people know the `whoami` command.

    $ whoami
    mroth

But what if you want to keep track of _how_ you are?

    $ howami
    Current weight: 161.4lbs (-4% past 30 days)*
    Activity level: 2765 steps thus far today
    Sleep last night: 6 hours, 14 minutes

howami uses the Fitbit API to give you a quick CLI glance at your vital stats as synchronized from your nerdy quantified-self tracking devices.

## Installation

Just install it via rubygems:

    $ gem install howami

Done.

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## What devices?

Since people keep asking, I personally use a Fitbit Aria scale to weigh myself, and a Fitbit Flex for activity/sleep tracking.  <small>(And I've lost 22lbs. at time of writing this!)</small>
